SquiiZZy is a complete penetration testing suite for ethical hackers and cybersecurity enthusiasts. It provides a variety of tools for performing various types of attacks, including port scanning, directory busting, SQL injection testing, web server scanning, payload creation, ARP spoofing, and MITM attacks.
🚀 Getting Started

To get started with SquiiZZy, you'll need to install the required dependencies. SquiiZZy is written in Python and uses several third-party libraries, including Nmap, Sqlmap, Nikto, and Metasploit. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package manager:

sh

pip install python-nmap sqlmap nikto

You'll also need to install Metasploit, which is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can download the latest version of Metasploit from the official website.

Once you've installed the required dependencies, you can start using SquiiZZy by running the squizzzy.py script:

sh

python squizzzy.py
